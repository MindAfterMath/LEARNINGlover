What is a cipher?
What is the inverse of a cipher?
What are the fixed points of a cipher?
What is an additive cipher?
When does an additive cipher have an inverse?
 - always
What are the fixed points of an additive cipher?
 - only if we are adding a multiple of 26 (the base)
What is a multliplicitave cipher?
When does a multiplicitave cipher have an inverse?
 - only is we are multiplying by something relatively prime to the base. 
What are the fixed points of a multiplicatave cipher?
 - 0 is always a fixed point, 
What is an affince cipher?
When does an affine cipher have an inverse?
What are the fixed points of an affine cipher?
 - when gcd(a - 1, m)does not divide b,
