If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you says to them, \"Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,\" but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit? Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. 18 But someone will say, \"You have faith, and I have works.\" Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe?and tremble! But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect? And the scripture was fulfilled which says, \"Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.\" And he was called the friend of God. You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only. Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way? For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.";
