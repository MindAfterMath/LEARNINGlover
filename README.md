HTML Source Code files for LEARNINGlover.com

This is a pull of the working and draft files I have at the site. The basic language is javascript to allow for dynamic page modification. The area of the programs is mathematics and computer science. Sometimes it will lean towards machine learning or data mining, but other times I will lean on some fundamental concets like data structures, sorting methods, or interesting/challenging math concepts. I will also do puzzles when I find one I enjoy but cannot seem to find enough of them on my own. 

By default, the fact that the programs are done in javascript means that they are open-source, but simply viewing the source at the web pages can be tiresome, and some devices (eg smartphones) do not make viewing HTML source code easy. I am putting the source code here to try to further the conversation (and hopefully the uderstanding) about these concepts.

Feel free to fork, download, test, play with and modify this code. I do not require any special permissions to do so. It is always interesting to hear about the ideas that people are able to come up with after reading my work, so feel free to let me know about those. 

And as always, if you notice an error in my code or a situation that shouldn't be, or code that can be improved upon, feel free to let me know. This shouldn't be just a teaching experience (for me) but also a learning experience and I'm always learning ways to improve my code.
